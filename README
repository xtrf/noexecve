Disable execve for select processes
───────────────────────────────────

libnoexecve.so is expected to be listed in /etc/ld.so.preload.

Once it is active, it will eximaine /proc/self/exe.  If this file has
an extended attribute "user.noexecve", it will install a seccomp
handler which blocks execve (and execveat, if defined at compilation
time).  You can set such an extended attribute on a program with:

  setfattr -n user.noexecve <program>

setfattr is part of the attr package.
